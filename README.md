# Portfolio Website Build

## Description
* A portfolio page to showcase my skills & talents for future employers to view.

* The portfolio includes Contact links, about me section & projects section.

* I have created a flex-box section with the projects. I thought this was quite fidgety & didn't work at times - though I think I figured it out.

*
